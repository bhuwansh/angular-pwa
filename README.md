<p>Progressive Web Apps <strong>(PWAs) </strong> are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications. PWAs are an emerging technology that combine the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers to provide benefits of a rich mobile experience.</p>

# When to build progressive web apps
<p>First and foremost, building PWAs are about user engagement. Users who don’t want to make extra clicks to download an app may be a significant part of your community. Stats from a recent comScore report prove this assumption is well-founded. More than 50 percent of US smartphone users don’t download even a single app a month. With a PWA, you can engage with this large user group even if you already have a native app. It also allows for saving a substantial amount of budget on native apps’ updates and maintenance.</p>

<p>As people mostly rely on wireless network and mobile connection, they are likely to prefer websites and apps using less data and remaining at least partly functional offline. And PWAs have it all.</p>
